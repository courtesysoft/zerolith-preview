Preview release aftermath and refinement
---------------------------------------------------------------------



Production release ~v1.30 ( WIP )
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] First - take TODOS out of all classes and put in here and sort what is for production readiness and what is for refinement

[ ] zmail
	[ ] cronjob to delete stored email after X months ( settable ), may be able to use existing db cleaner script
		[ ] add instructions on how to set that up

[ ] Zperm
	[ ] user types -> levels array ( new zdb variable in zl::$site )
	[ ] hasUserTypeOrAbove()
	[ ] finish hasPermission() and allow it to accept string ( 1 check ) or keyed array ( multiple checks )
	[ ] finish rest of missing functions

[ ] Zpage
	[ ] Move Zpage settings to their own array because they're about to get big (zl::$page -> zpage::$set)
	[ ] add variable to before/after for every html aspect ( start/nav/end )
	[ ] callbacks for nav generation, avatar, notifications
	[ ] multi level navigation

[ ] zpta 2.0
	[ ] consider katrina's idea of associated array of associated arrays for definition; would be clearer
	[ ] can we generate a search bar?
	[ ] fix page forward/backwards issue
	[ ] add parameter to make filtering happen easily

[ ] External zlhx files
	[ ] Test usage in zlhx demo
	[ ] Add guidance on how to use externally + internally

[ ] Finish zlite
	[ ] homogenize to work like zdb
		[ ] add default database setting in zl_config
		[ ] use same switching mechanism
	[ ] document it
	[ ] add check for sqlite extension on zenvCheck::init if sqlite database set to something other than ''

[ ] zl.php
	[ ] improve boot speed/simplicity
		[ ] turn bootup consts into variables ( faster, can remove their mem use )
		[ ] turn paths into variables in config and ZL lookups ( faster/less mem )
		[ ] is zptas class faster in nginx?

[ ] zmail
	[ ] design way to store and read list of categories of emails user doesn't
		[ ] give example
		[ ] use database lookup to produce

[ ] copy system panel from pom
	[ ] create zl_config database table
		[ ] minimum: devEmailForward, maintenance message,

[ ] zdebug
	[ ] reform quips
		[ ] form arrays in one compound statement ( faster? ), or use variables instead of arrays. Run profiler to find option
		[ ] zui::readmore is slow when used en-masse in debugger. Can we send full text and clip with javascript?
		[ ] debugging is mature - can we skip using the abstractions in high frequency libraries like zdb::, and use straight text formation  for moar speed?
	[ ] break debugger into it's own class, debug settings into their own array,

[ ] zdb
	[ ] fix debug timing
	[ ] Investigate mr. covirgance's claim about bind variables making things slower when using parameterized database reads
	"Thatâ€™s probably the bind variable issue. Try pulling a query plan with injected values and with bind variables. It might be hard to find a tool for the latter. But if you can, the results can be eye opening.
	Missed indexes, partition scans, poor joins, etc."
	[ ] Add button to SQL explain query on any query using JS
