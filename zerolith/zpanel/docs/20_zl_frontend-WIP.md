# ZL Frontend

The zerolith frontend encompasses all parts of frontend development:
1. CSS utility framework - zl.css
2. HTML element output library - zui::
3. HTMX integration with ZLHX
4. HTML table generator with filtering, sorting, positioning, paginating, and extensive styling - zPTA

It is intended to be a mostly complete set of tools for writing frontends without requiring large additional dependencies.
