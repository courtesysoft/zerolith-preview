# Statement of political and social neutrality

Zerolith is a tool for building web software.

Zerolith has nothing to do with:
- Sexuality or gender identity
- Politics or political affiliation
- Race
- Nationality
- Culture
- Anything else related to group identity, whether mutable or immutable.

Zerolith don't use people's group identities to:
- discriminate against people who use the software
- discriminate against contributors
- discriminate against any staff hired to work on Zerolith
...to the maximum extent that is legal in Zerolith's country of origin ( USA ).

We believe mixing unrelated agendas into software development isn't appropriate and distracts from building excellent tools.
Zerolith and Zerolith's communities will not be used as a vessel for these kinds of things.

Zerolith is a gift to the world, and all it's people, for better or worse!
