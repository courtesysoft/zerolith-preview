# Zcurl

Zcurl implements both calling cURL for a single request, or two ways to do a bulk, asynchronous call: static class, and instantiated class based.
It also includes debugging information on in/out, as well as time spent on cURL requests.
It is a lightweight, optimized, but spartan cURL library.


### Usage
